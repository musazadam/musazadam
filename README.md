â”€â”€(arch@enes)-[~]-$ cat README.md 

Hi! I am a 14 year-old boy who's interested in cybersecurity/programming and Linux distributions, which I'm trying to learn more about. It may be hard for me, which is a little strange for my age since most kids my age are chasing other dreams such as playing football, going to boxing/karate/MMA, playing games, and so on. I'm also interested in electronics, which I do the most, and networking, too, but I don't really have tools for that. I chase my dreams instead of listening to people's opinions, the reason most people give up; don't do that, please. Anyways, enough talking, have a great day. I use Arch btw.
